#WSDL-JS

WSDL-JS is entirely written in javascript. WSDL-JS downloads and parses a remote wsdl in javascript. To overcome CORS related issues with remote api, It uses socket-fetch library which makes http connections using web sockets instead of Ajax XMLHttpRequest. It also uses X2JS library to parse xml to json and vice versa. 

Example

Add the following in the head section
```
<link rel="import" href="/socket-fetch/socket-fetch.html">
<script src="/abdmob/x2js/xml2json.min.js"></script>
<script src="wsdl.js"></script>
```
Use below code to download and parse wsdl. 
```
var apiService = 'https://www.example.com/someservice.svc?wsdl';
 var w = new wsdl(apiService);
  w.load().then(function () {
    //Once loaded call createRequests, to parse each operation and associated types.
     w.createRequests();
    //to get operations
    var operations = w.operations;
                
  }
```

###Still some work pending around types. Currently it imports complex types from schema uri only but doesn't parse embedded ones.
